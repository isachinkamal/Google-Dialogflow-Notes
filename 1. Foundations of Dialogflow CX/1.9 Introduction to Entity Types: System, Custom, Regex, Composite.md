# **1.9 Introduction to Entity Types: System, Custom, Regex, Composite**

---

## **What Are Entities in Dialogflow CX?** 

Entities in Dialogflow CX are essential for turning vague or unstructured user input into meaningful, actionable data. Think of them as the magical filters that sift through the user's language to grab the nuggets your bot actually needs. Whether someone says “next Friday” or “tomorrow,” your agent needs to translate that into something it can work with—like a precise date object. That's where entities step in.

Entities act as the “what” in your bot's world. If intents are about the user’s purpose (“I want to order”), entities extract the details of that purpose (“one pepperoni pizza,” “for pickup,” “at 8 PM”). In CX, you attach entities to parameters, which are the actual containers your bot uses to store extracted data across pages and flows. These values then help power conditional logic, call webhooks, or populate dynamic responses.

This separation of structure and semantics is what allows your CX agent to operate like a proper application—with data inputs, validation, logic, and output—all running invisibly behind the conversational curtain.

## **Entity Types in Dialogflow CX** 

Dialogflow CX offers four primary types of entities—each with its own purpose, capabilities, and usage patterns. Picking the right type at the right time is half the battle when it comes to building scalable, maintainable bots.

For example, if you're collecting standardized data like phone numbers or dates, System Entities are your best bet—they're battle-tested and require no additional configuration. On the other hand, if your bot deals with domain-specific language, such as "PrimePlus subscription" or "Anti-Virus Ultra," then you’ll want to build Custom Entities to teach CX your organization’s specific vocabulary.

Regex entities shine when inputs follow rigid patterns—like license keys or transaction IDs. Composite entities are where things get sophisticated, letting you model nested structures like full shipping addresses or complex product configurations.

Understanding these types not only makes your bot smarter but also keeps your codebase clean and your team sane as your agent grows in complexity.

## **1. System Entities** 

System Entities (`@sys.*`) are the pre-trained champions of Dialogflow CX. These are built-in entity types created by Google to handle commonly encountered data types without any configuration. The benefit here is immense—Google has already trained these entities with vast datasets and localization support, so you don’t need to reinvent the wheel.

Let’s say you ask, “Book a table for three on Friday at 7.” System entities instantly extract:

* `@sys.number = 3`
* `@sys.date = [next Friday’s ISO date]`
* `@sys.time = 19:00`

The sheer breadth of supported formats is incredible. Users can say “half past seven,” “quarter to eight,” or “in the evening,” and the system will attempt to normalize it.

Here are some widely used system entities:

* `@sys.number`, `@sys.date`, `@sys.time`
* `@sys.duration`, `@sys.percentage`, `@sys.currency`
* `@sys.location`, `@sys.email`, `@sys.url`
* `@sys.person`, `@sys.phone-number`

**Benefits:**

* Saves development time
* Internationalization support (formats vary globally)
* Consistent and validated extraction

**Best Practices:**

* Combine with conditions (`if $session.params.date < $sys.date.now`)
* Always test locale-dependent phrases
* Avoid overriding unless necessary (e.g., reusing @sys.location for a fictional map)

---

## **2. Custom Entities** 

Custom Entities are where your bot becomes industry-aware. Whether you’re in insurance, travel, retail, or tech support, your domain has unique vocabulary. That’s what custom entities are for. You define them based on how your users speak, and CX learns to recognize them using synonyms and variants.

For instance, in a customer support bot, you might define:

* `@issue_type`: internet not working, slow speed, VPN issues
* `@plan_type`: basic, premium, ultimate
* `@device_type`: modem, router, mobile, laptop

Each entry can have multiple synonyms. For `premium`, you could add: “gold plan,” “plus pack,” or “upgraded.”

CX will normalize these to `premium`, allowing consistent backend logic and data processing.

You can also set:

* **Redaction**: For PII (e.g., `@user_name`)
* **Multi-select support**: Useful when users list multiple options
* **Fuzzy matching**: Helps with typos or partial matches like “peproni”

**Use Cases:**

* Menus (food items, services, plans)
* Complaint categories
* Product SKUs
* Customer tiers

**Best Practices:**

* Use clean, non-overlapping values
* Avoid huge synonym lists (adds noise)
* Document entity-to-backend mapping (e.g., pizza topping → inventory ID)

---

## **3. Regex Entities** 

Regex Entities are your go-to when the data follows a specific, strict format that natural language recognition can’t handle reliably. For example, if you’re building a banking bot that requires users to input their 10-digit account number, or a bot that verifies codes like “INV-92384,” regex entities let you use regular expressions to define those patterns explicitly.

This avoids over-matching or misinterpretation from system or custom entities, which might struggle with sequences of digits or letters.

**Sample Regex Patterns:**

* Credit card numbers: `[0-9]{16}`
* Indian PIN codes: `[1-9][0-9]{5}`
* Invoice IDs: `INV-[0-9]{4,6}`
* Order IDs: `ORD-[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{4}`

Regex entities are non-trainable, but they are surgically precise. They allow you to validate structured text input before performing any downstream logic like API lookups or webhook actions.

**Important Caveats:**

* They are greedy: will match wherever they can
* They don’t understand context—use them for format, not meaning
* There’s no fuzzy matching or synonyms—only pattern match

**Best Practices:**

* Test regex outside CX using tools like [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
* Combine with parameter validation logic in webhooks
* Use clear prompts so users know the expected format

## **4. Composite Entities** 

Composite Entities are Dialogflow CX’s way of representing structured data—kind of like mini-JSONs inside your bot. They allow you to group related parameters that naturally occur together and manage them as a single unit. This is extremely useful in complex use cases like:

* Booking travel itineraries
* Capturing addresses
* Collecting product configuration details

Let’s take the example of a hotel reservation:

```json
@booking_request
{
  "room_type": @room_type,
  "guest_count": @sys.number,
  "check_in_date": @sys.date,
  "check_out_date": @sys.date
}
```

When a user says:

> “I want a deluxe room for 3 guests from July 12 to July 15”

Your bot can extract all four parameters at once—neatly nested and ready to process.

**Advanced Features:**

* Composite nesting (composite inside composite)
* Rich parameter referencing: `$session.params.booking_request.check_in_date`
* Easy handoff to webhook: send structured payloads

**Best Practices:**

* Only group tightly related items
* Avoid nesting too deep (makes debugging harder)
* Test edge cases where users mention partial data (“I’ll tell you the checkout date later”)

Composite entities can make your bot feel truly intelligent—almost like it’s “understanding” user input rather than just reacting to it.

## **Entity Lifecycles: How Entities Work in Flows** 

Entities don’t live in isolation—they’re tightly coupled to **parameters**, which are the gears and levers of a Dialogflow CX flow. Once an entity is recognized, its value is captured and stored as a parameter (usually via a form or route match). This parameter then flows through your conversation architecture like a river of meaning.

Here's a typical lifecycle:

1. **Intent matched:** Bot understands the user’s goal.
2. **Entities extracted:** Values like dates, categories, IDs are captured.
3. **Parameters assigned:** These entities are mapped to `parameter_name`.
4. **Session variable set:** Automatically saved to `$session.params.parameter_name`.
5. **Used for routing, conditions, fulfillment, or webhook calls.**

You can inspect or update these parameters using:

* Inline condition blocks (e.g., `$session.params.payment_type == 'UPI'`)
* Fulfillment logic (return different messages based on values)
* Webhooks (pass all parameters as JSON to your backend)

Pro Tip: If a parameter isn't captured, CX can reprompt based on the form configuration. This makes it highly robust for collecting structured data from even the most chaotic users.

## **Common Pitfalls to Avoid** 

Dialogflow CX gives you powerful tools, but with power comes… well, mistakes. Here are the top entity-related blunders you’ll want to avoid like hard-coded passwords:

### 1. **Entity Overlap**

Don’t let multiple entities compete over the same words. For example:

* `@product_name`: “basic”, “premium”
* `@support_level`: “basic”, “advanced”

If both are active, CX may not know which one to prioritize. Resolve this with disambiguation pages or combine the entities into a unified one.

### 2. **Ignoring Parameters on Flows**

If you forget to mark parameters as “required,” CX won’t prompt the user to provide missing data. Use form-based pages to ensure required fields are collected gracefully.

### 3. **Using Regex When Not Needed**

Regex is powerful but unforgiving. If you try to use it for natural language (e.g., matching “twenty-five” instead of “25”), you’re better off with a system or custom entity.

### 4. **No Fallback Plans**

Always have fallback routes in case entity extraction fails. You can retry, reprompt, or ask for clarification. Otherwise, your bot just... dies inside.

## **Real-World Entity Design Examples** 

### A. **Healthcare Appointment Bot**

* `@doctor_specialty`: cardiologist, neurologist, pediatrician
* `@appointment_time`: @sys.time
* `@symptom`: headache, nausea, chest pain

You can create composite entities like `@visit_detail` to group everything and send to the EMR system via webhook.

### B. **FinTech Lending Bot**

* `@loan_type`: personal, home, education
* `@amount`: @sys.currency
* `@credit_score`: Regex `[0-9]{3}`

You can guide users through a loan pre-approval flow based on extracted values.

## **Summary: Choosing the Right Entity Type** 

If you're confused about which entity type to use, use this cheat sheet:

| Scenario                              | Use This Entity Type |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Dates, numbers, currencies            | System (`@sys.*`)    |
| Product categories, toppings, tiers   | Custom               |
| Order IDs, codes, structured patterns | Regex                |
| Address blocks, booking details       | Composite            |

And always test under real-world scenarios. Simulated users are nice, but real customers are unpredictable.

## **Final Thoughts**

Entities are more than tags—they’re the very DNA of your conversational experience. They make your bot smarter, your flows cleaner, and your users happier. With Dialogflow CX's powerful entity types, you can model almost any business scenario—from food ordering to legal claim filing to smart IoT device control.

Take time to architect your entities well. Document them, review them periodically, and validate them with real inputs. Because in the end, the more structure your bot can extract, the more *value* it can deliver.
